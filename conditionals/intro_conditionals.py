# Two types of conditionals in Python:
#   1- Conditional execution.
#      a. IF / ELIF / ELSE would be an example.
#
#   2- Conditional expressions.
#      a. i.e. s = "Less than" if a < b else "not less than"
#         * we have a value that's getting assigned ONLY if this condition is true; otherwise
#           this other value would be assigned.
#      b. you've probably seen this in other languages done with question marks and colons.
